# pep2peaks

pep2peaks:基于seq2seq的内部离子的强度预测模型

１,环境需求：python 3.5.2，tendorflow GPU 1.8.0

2,数据
	实验数据为.txt格式的文本文档。
	其内容格式为：
	peptide[tab]charge[tab]ion[tab]modification[tab]ion-mass[tab]ion-type[tab]ion-relative-intensity[tab]ion-absolute-intensity
	且在该模型中，常规离子数据为带1个和2个电荷的离子，而内部离子仅为带1个电荷的离子。
	
	例：
	某条肽序列的常规离子的内容为

3,使用pep2peaks
	本实验中已经训练好的模型存放于models/目录下面。
	对于单条肽序列的预测，本实验提供了示例接口位于example.py。对于多条肽的预测，需要将肽序列写入文件中，文件内容格式如上所示，预测脚本位于model/pep2peaks.py，并将参数is_train设置为2，表示仅测试。如果需要重新训练，则将该参数设置为1。另外，对于不同的离子类型，需要设置不同的参数，如下图所示：
